# Session Changelog

## [2026-09-25] Project Initialization & Architecture Enforcement
- **Architectural Changes:** 
  - Restructured project to follow the strict 3-layer architecture defined in `AGENTS.md`.
  - Created `directives/` for markdown SOPs (Layer 1).
  - Created `execution/` for deterministic python tools (Layer 3).
  - Created `.tmp/` for scratch files and intermediate outputs (e.g., exploratory analysis scripts).
  - Initialized `.env` and this `AI_ONBOARDING.md` log.
- **Data Movement:** Moved the initial exploratory script (`analyze_datasets.py`) into `.tmp/` as it was a scratch task to understand the data.
- **Next Steps:** Begin converting the competition strategy (from `AI_CONTEXT.md` / `competition_analysis_report.md`) into formalized Markdown SOPs within `directives/` and write the corresponding deterministic tools in `execution/` starting with the data validation and baseline generation.

## [2026-09-25] Experiment 1: Baseline Matching
- **Implementation:** Created `directives/baseline_matching.md` (Layer 1) and `execution/run_baseline.py` (Layer 3).
- **Strategy:** Exact string match on normalized `business_name`, partitioned by country.
- **Results:** Achieved a local F0.5 score of 0.19372. This confirms that simple exact matching is insufficient due to typos, transliteration, and missing data.
- **Next Steps:** Implement Experiment 2 (Blocking) using TF-IDF character n-grams to drastically improve the recall ceiling before training an ML model.
